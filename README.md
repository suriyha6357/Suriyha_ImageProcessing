# Suriyha_ImageProcessing
This project implements a complete Digital Image Processing (DIP) pipeline, including image acquisition, noise simulation, preprocessing, filtering, thresholding, and edge detection. It evaluates Median and Gaussian filters using PSNR and SSIM, and performs object segmentation and feature extraction under varied noise and blur conditions.
